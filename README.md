*Operon* is a modern C++ framework for [symbolic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_regression) that uses [genetic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming) to explore a hypothesis space of possible mathematical expressions in order to find the best-fitting model for a given [regression target](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis).
Its main purpose is to help develop accurate and interpretable white-box models in the area of [system identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_identification). More in-depth documentation available at https://operongp.readthedocs.io/.

## How does it work?

Broadly speaking, genetic programming (GP) is said to evolve a population of "computer programs" ― [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)-like structures encoding behavior for a given problem domain ― following the principles of [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection). It repeatedly combines random program parts keeping only the best results ― the "fittest". Here, the biological concept of [fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest) is defined as a measure of a program's ability to solve a certain task.

In symbolic regression, the programs represent mathematical expressions typically encoded as [expression trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree). Fitness is usually defined as [goodness of fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit) between the dependent variable and the prediction of a tree-encoded model. Iterative selection of best-scoring models followed by random recombination leads naturally to a self-improving process that is able to uncover patterns in the data:

## Build instructions

The project requires CMake and a C++17 compliant compiler (C++20 if you're on the `cpp20` branch). The recommended way to build Operon is via either [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) or [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

Check out [https://github.com/heal-research/operon/blob/master/BUILDING.md](BUILD.md) for detailed build instructions and how to enable/disable certain features.

### Nix

First, you have to [install nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) and [enable flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).
For a portable install, see [nix-portable](https://github.com/DavHau/nix-portable).

To create a development shell:
```
nix develop github:heal-research/operon --no-write-lock-file
```

To build Operon (a symlink to the nix store called `result` will be created).
```
nix build github:heal-research/operon --no-write-lock-file
```


### Vcpkg

Select the build generator appropriate for your system and point CMake to the `vcpkg.cmake` toolchain file

```
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 \
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=..\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake \
-DVCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS=.\ports
```

The file `CMakePresets.json` contains some presets that you may find useful. For using `clang-cl` instead of `cl`, pass `-TClangCL` to the above ([official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-cmake?view=msvc-170)).

## Python wrapper

Python bindings for the Operon library are available as a separate project: [PyOperon](https://github.com/heal-research/pyoperon), which also includes a [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) compatible regressor.
